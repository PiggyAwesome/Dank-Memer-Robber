# Dank-Memer-Robber
An easy GUI for Dank Memer robbers!

This application is against the Discord AND Dank Memer TOS. I only created this program as a proof of concept. I advise you to not use this program, even if the chances of you getting banned are really slim.

It is advised to read through the entire Readme before running this program. If you post an issue, but you have not followed all of these steps - it will instantly be closed.

### How to set up:

1. Go into main.py and add your discord user token:
```py
bot = discum.Client(token="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE", log=False)
```
2. Add your own server info in servers.json
```json
    "private": {                       // You must have a private server. This is where balance checks and non interactive commands get executed
        "channelID": 69696969,         // Channel ID where the commands will be sent
        "guildID": 69696969,           // Guild ID of your private server
        "cooldown": 20                 // Cooldown in seconds for the /rob command
    },
    
    "johnnys server": {                // You can add rob servers like this and name them anything you want
        "channelID": 69696969,         // Channel ID where the commands will be sent
        "guildID": 69696969,           // Guild ID of server 
        "cooldown": 20                 // Cooldown in seconds for the /rob command
    },
    
    ...
```
